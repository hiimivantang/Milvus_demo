Our mission is to grow and empower local economies.Technology has changed consumer behavior and driven a wave of demand for convenience. Consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy withevery purchase has been a boon for some companies but damaging for many others. We enable local brick-and-mortar businesses—which arefundamental to the vitality of local economies and communities—to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in anincreasingly convenience-driven economy. Our local logistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants, over 20 million consumers, and over 1million Dashers in the United States, Canada, and Australia every month.We built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through the DoorDash Marketplace, or ourMarketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition,delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish anonline presence and expand their reach. It generates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchantscan fulfill this demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers.In addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a variety of products, which we referto as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated through their own channels. DoorDash Drive, or Drive, our white-labellogistics service, enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our locallogistics platform. DoorDash Storefront, or Storefront, enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing themwith a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.THE DOORDASH PLATFORMOur local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. We built our local logistics platform to serve the needs of these three keyconstituencies and to become more intelligent and efficient with every order.
