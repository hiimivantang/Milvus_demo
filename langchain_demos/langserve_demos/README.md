Welcome to this repository! In this project, we demonstrate how to build intelligent applications using LangServe and LangGraph from the LangChain ecosystem, and how to leverage [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) as a high-performance vector database. This setup enables efficient data retrieval and powerful language model capabilities.

## What You'll Learn
* Setting up a FastAPI application with LangServe and LangGraph.
* Integrating Milvus for vector storage and retrieval.
* Building an LLM Agent with LangGraph.
